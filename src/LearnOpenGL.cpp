	// Link the Vertex Attributes
	// We need to specify how openGL should read our vertex buffer. We have it set up as a linear
	// array of floats, with each vertex having 3 entries. An 'attribute' is how we specify our inputs

	glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 3 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
	glEnableVertexAttribArray(0); // vertex attributes are disabled by default
	// Explanation of parameters: 
		// GLuint index: We set the "position" attribute (aPos) in the vertex shader to 0. We set this
		//               index to 0 to match that, so we're setting attribute 0 (which is aPos)
		// GLint size: This attr is a vec3, so it has 3 values
		// GLenum type: we're reading an array of floats
		// GLboolean normalized: do we want to normalize this? We don't need to since our input
		//                       float is already normalized
		// GLsizei stride: The space btwn consecutive vertex attributes (in bytes). We could also
		//                 set this to 0 if we know the array is tightly packed (ours is)
		// const void* pointer: the offset of where the position data begins in the buffer.
		//                      Our data is at the start of the array, so this is 0
	// Remember, we set VBO as the current GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, which is where we're pulling the 
	// data for the attributes when we call glVertexAttribPointer

	// ^all of this is a long way to do it. We have to call:
	// glBindBuffer
	// glBufferData
	// glVertexAttribPointer
	// glEnableVertexAttribArray
	// glUseProgram
	// Then, we can actually draw the object. We'd need to repeat this for EVERY new object. Use a VAO instead
	*/

	// Set up a Vertex Array Object (VAO)
	// Basically, all the states we just set can be stored in the VAO, so we only have to bind the VAO when
	// switching to a different set of vertex data/attribute configurations
	// NOTE: OpenGL 'core' requires you to use VAOs
	// Each object that you draw will have its own VAO
	// Usually, you want to generate the VAOs for all the objects you want at the start of the program, and store them for later use
	unsigned int VAO;

	// Make the EBO. Just like the VBO, bind the element buffer, add stuff to it, then unbind it
	// note: the last element array buffer object bound to a VAO gets stored as that VAO's element buffer object.
	// from now on, binding to the VAO will also bind to this EBO
	glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, EBO);
	glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(indices), indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
	// Set our vertex attributes pointers
	// Position Attribute
	glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
	glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
	// Color Attribute
	//NOTE: since the color starts after the 3rd element, our *pointer is also offset by 3 floats
	glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)(3 * sizeof(float)));
	glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);
	// Now, if we want to draw an object, we just bind VAO and draw it using some opengl draw function
	// See the render loop for how to actually use this
	// IMPORTANT NOTE: a VAO can only have 1 EBO and 1 VBO. It can have many different (16?) attributes pointers (each one of which points 
	// to a different spot in the VBO). The EBO doesn't have attributes like the VBO does (I think)

	// Optional: you can unbind the VBO and VAO so that further calls don't modify them. In general, THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
	// It's safe to unbind VBO here; the call to glVertexAttribPointer registered VBO as VAO's bound vertex buffer object
	glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
	// next, we can unbind VAO so that we don't accidentally modify if later
	glBindVertexArray(0);
	// ONLY AFTER VAO is unbound, we can unbind the element buffer. You CANNOT unbind this while VAO is active, or VAO will stop 
	// recognizing it as the current EBO
